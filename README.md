### Welcome to Simple WPF/C# Knob Control
This project is providing an opensource simple WPF/C# based knob control.
As it is really hard to find a free & simple WPF knob control, I made one.

Knob Control is made under 64bit Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition. I think, hopefully, there will be not problem to build and run it in other version of Windows or Visual Studios.

It was written with elementary functions and WPF components such as ellipse, textbox, grid, viewbox and arc, so programmers with any level can understand how it works.


### Main Features
* Value indicating arc.
* Value change by mouse wheel control.
* Value change by click-and-drag.
* Two colors for indicating arc can be set for the minimum value and the maximum value respectively. As value change from the minimum to maximum, the color for the arc also gradually change.
* All knob control's control properties can be edited in XAML editor the following image
